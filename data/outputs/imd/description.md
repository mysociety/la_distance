The similarity between authorities is calculated by the proportion of the population living in high deprivation (1st quintile), medium deprivation (2nd-3rd quintile) and low deprivation (4th and 5th quintile) neighbourhoods. The population density is also used to help distinguish between authorities with very similar profiles of deprivation. 

The labelling scheme is based on a composite score for the whole local authority. The quintile labels are assigned based on lower-tier population, and county and combined authorities are then slotted into based on their relative score. 

This UK-wide comparison is based on a [Composite Index of Multiple Deprivation](https://github.com/mysociety/composite_uk_imd) system.
